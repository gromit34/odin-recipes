      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Sharp blue cheese meets spicy seasoning in this flavorful burger recipe. Don't forget to give yourself enough time to let the blackening spice really meld with the patties before throwing them on the grill.</p>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 cups cooked bacon, chopped</li>
        <li>1 cup green onions, chopped</li>
        <li>6 ounces Danish blue cheese, crumbled</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>2 pounds ground beef</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat a grill to medium heat.</li>
        <li>Prepare the burgers: Whisk eggs in a bowl and stir in bacon, green onions, blue cheese, garlic, and Worcestershire sauce.</li>
        <li>Mix beef and egg mixture in a large bowl with a fork.</li>
        <li>Shape into 8 burger patties.</li>
        <li>Make the blackening spice: Whisk together brown sugar, red pepper flakes, onion powder, salt, pepper, and oregano. Dust spice mix onto patties. Be sure to lightly rub the blackening spice onto each side and let rest in the refrigerator for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place patties on the preheated grill. Cover and cook 6 to 8 minutes per side, or to desired doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Fix the buns: Once cooked, place each burger into a warmed bun and add your favorite toppings.</li>
      </ol>
